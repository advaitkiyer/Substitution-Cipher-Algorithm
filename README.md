# Encryption and Decryption

A basic substitution cipher algorithm for encryption and decryption in C++.

## Appendix


### Substitution Cipher

The Substitution Cipher is an encryption method that involves replacing each letter in the plaintext with a different letter, determined by a predefined key. It functions by substituting characters to generate the corresponding ciphertext.

### Encryption 

1. Choosing a key: The key defines the mapping between the original alphabet and the substituted alphabet.

2. Mapping each letter: For each letter in the plaintext, substitute it with the corresponding letter from the key.

3. Generating the ciphertext: The resulting substituted letters form the ciphertext, which represents the encrypted message.

### Decryption

1. Obtaining the key: To decrypt the ciphertext, you need the same key used for encryption.

2. Reversing the mapping: Using the key to reverse the substitution process and replacing each ciphertext letter with the corresponding plaintext letter based on the key.

3. Retrieving the plaintext: The reversed substitution generates the original plaintext, recovering the message.
